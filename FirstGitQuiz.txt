Match the command with its definition.

response - correct
Git Init command Creates a new Git repository
Git Status command Tells you what has changed since the last commit.
Git add is The command you need to run before git commit



How do you add a message to a git commit?

Add -m "message" at the end of git commit.



Correct: Yes, adding the option -m indicates that you're including a
message indicating the purpose of the commit.
You'll then add the message inside double quotes, so that the final command
reads git commit -m "message".

create new repository = git Init
status = changes since last commit
add = last command to run before commit

mnemonic - INIT STATUS ADD //in order of creation to commiting a new repository
